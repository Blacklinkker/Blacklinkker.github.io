        description="Using the Arduino Uno board, an infrared receptor and a generic TV remote, 
        i programmed some simple commands so when a certain key is pressed the servo will move accordingly to my code."

        title="Remote control Flamethrower (under development)"
        description="Using a Arduino Uno, a Servo, some pieces of wood and a deodorant flask, i built a 'robot' that would throw flames 
        every time i pressed the middle buttton of the remote control. The first protype ignited the flames by using a candle (Extremely dangerous!),
        the version 2.0 will use some sort of electronic ignition and hopefully it will also be controlled via wifi."

        description=" With the concept of The Useless Box in mind, using a LDR sensor and a servo 
        i created this robot to turn off the lights by flipping the switch off every time it was turned on."

        description="Using the Arduino board, a LDR luminosity sensor and a old toy's laser pointer, i made a simple (and pretty annoying) alarm clock that
        only stops when i shine the laser at the sensor."
